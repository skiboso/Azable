# Payment Stream Contract

## Overview

The `PaymentStreamContract` is the main Soroban contract for Azable's streaming engine. It manages escrowed token payments, vesting schedules, optional cliff periods, protocol fee accounting, sender/delegate controls, emergency pauses, and admin-managed dispute resolution.

This document reflects the live contract interface and is intended as an ABI-style reference, including data shapes, function signatures, return types, and event payloads.

## Contract Type Definitions

### `StreamStatus`

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub enum StreamStatus {
    Active,
    Paused,
    Canceled,
    Completed,
    Disputed,
}
```

Meaning:

- `Active`: stream is vesting normally
- `Paused`: stream is temporarily frozen by sender
- `Canceled`: stream was canceled by sender; remaining escrow can be refunded
- `Completed`: stream has fully vested/settled
- `Disputed`: dispute is queued and the stream is temporarily blocked

### `Stream`

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Stream {
    pub id: u64,
    pub sender: Address,
    pub recipient: Address,
    pub token: Address,
    pub total_amount: i128,
    pub balance: i128,
    pub withdrawn_amount: i128,
    pub start_time: u64,
    pub cliff_duration: u64,
    pub end_time: u64,
    pub status: StreamStatus,
    pub paused_at: Option<u64>,
    pub total_paused_duration: u64,
}
```

### `StreamParams`

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct StreamParams {
    pub recipient: Address,
    pub token: Address,
    pub total_amount: i128,
    pub initial_amount: i128,
    pub start_time: u64,
    pub end_time: u64,
    pub cliff_duration: u64,
}
```

### `StreamMetrics`

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct StreamMetrics {
    pub last_activity: u64,
    pub total_withdrawn: i128,
    pub withdrawal_count: u32,
    pub pause_count: u32,
    pub total_delegations: u32,
    pub current_delegate: Option<Address>,
    pub last_delegation_time: u64,
}
```

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct ProtocolMetrics {
    pub total_active_streams: u64,
    pub total_tokens_streamed: i128,
    pub total_streams_created: u64,
    pub total_delegations: u64,
}
```

### `QueuedResolution`

```rust
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct QueuedResolution {
    pub dispute_id: u64,
    pub stream_id: u64,
    pub recipient_amount: i128,
    pub sender_amount: i128,
    pub execute_after: u64,
    pub executed: bool,
    pub previous_status: StreamStatus,
}
```

## Notes for SDK Consumers

The generated SDK surface in `packages/sdk/src/generated/payment-stream/src/index.ts` mirrors these contract types and methods. In TypeScript, the values align to:

- `u64` => `bigint` / `number` depending on runtime context
- `i128` => `bigint`
- `Address` => `string`
- `Vec<T>` => `T[]` in generated wrappers
- `Option<T>` => `T | null` / `undefined` in SDK code patterns

The contract supports both standard vesting flows and edge cases like emergency pause, dispute timelocks, and cross-asset top-ups through the configured DEX router.
